Analysis of the scientific literature on endometriosis (1925-2020)

This repositery provides the main scripts used in the Endosci project. The main objective of this project was to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the scientific literature dedicated to a common gynecological disease (endometriosis) alongside different perspectives: level of effort, studied topics, geography and gender. It provides valuable context information to people interested in endometriosis, and could be used to feed public debates regarding the future of scientific research and healthcare issues linked to this condition.

Full information on the project is available at: http://dismalscience.eu

This repository is structured as following: 

1. Data processing and enrichment (scripts and datasets used to produce the consolidated data needed for the project)
2. Topic modelling (specific approach to identify the topics in the literature - LDA algorithm)
3. Sensitivity analysis (checking the robustness of the gender attributed to first names)
4. Graphs and maps (production of interactive and other graphs and maps)

Please do not hesitate to get back to me if you have any comments or spot mistakes in the code.
